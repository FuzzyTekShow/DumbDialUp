Well now you don't have to!  

## What?

When run, *DumbDialUp* will disable your internet connection until it has finished "dialing up".  
(Only tested on Ethernet connections but SHOULD work elsewhere, lemme know via an issue if you have any, well issues...)  

If you hold **LEFT SHIFT** when starting it will toggle start on boot, hold LEFT SHIFT again when starting to disable it or you can manually delete it from "Task Scheduler" in Windows.
